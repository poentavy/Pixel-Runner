# Pixel Runner

Pixel Runner is a simple side-scrolling endless runner game implemented using the Pygame library in Python. The player controls a character who runs continuously, and the goal is to survive as long as possible while avoiding obstacles.

## Gameplay

- The player character automatically moves forward, and the player's task is to keep the character alive.
- The character can jump by pressing the Space key or by clicking the mouse button.
- The character must avoid colliding with flying creatures (flies) and ground creatures (snails) that appear randomly.
- If the character collides with an obstacle, the game ends.
- The player can restart the game by pressing the Shift key.

## Features

- The game has a simple and intuitive control scheme, allowing the player to jump and avoid obstacles easily.
- The game includes a scoring system that keeps track of the player's survival time.
- The game features sound effects, including a jumping sound and background music.
- The game has a visually appealing pixel art style with smooth animations.
- The game includes a game over screen that displays the player's score and provides the option to restart the game.
